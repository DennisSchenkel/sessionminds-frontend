## Agile Project Management

This project was developed using an agile approach for structuring backend and frontend functionalities, as well as planning and tracking the development process. The project was separated into several milestones, each containing one or multiple user stories, each being structured into several different tasks. Additionally, tasks were divided into frontend (FE) and backend (BE) tasks.

For naming convention, milestones were numbered, starting with 0 for the basic project setup and going up in numbers, based on the logical next development steps. Each User Story was marked with "MS-X", and X standing for the associated milestone. Each task was then marked with (FE) for frontend and (BE) for backend.

The final structure looks like this:

- (MS-1) Profiles
- (MS-1) - USER STORY: User profiles
- (MS-1) - FE - TASK: Profile information page

Each user story and task was also labeled using the MoSCoW methodology with the tags must have, should have, could have and won't have. Also tags for user story and task were used.

**Profile App (BE)**
In this project, the Django profile app with its structure is greatly inspired and by part copied from the Code Institute examples, although customized in many places.
